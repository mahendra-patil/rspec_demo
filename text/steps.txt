why stub and Mock:->
Stub vs Mock Objects in Java testing. As I said both Stub and Mock are dummy object, but more precisely, a Stub is an object
that simulates real objects with the minimum number of methods required for a test. ...
Stub object is usually used for state verification, while mock object is mostly used for behaviour verification ...

what stub and Mock:->
  A fake is a generic term that can be used to describe either a stub or a mock object (handwritten or otherwise),
  because they both look like the real object. Whether a fake is a stub or a mock depends\
  on how it's used in the current test. If it's used to check an interaction (asserted against), it's a mock object.

how:->
A Mock is just testing behaviour, making sure certain methods are called. A Stub is a testable version (per se) of a particular
object.
Mock is like actually stepping into the method and making sure everything inside is correct before returning the correct value.

2) what Shoulda Matchers :-> is a Ruby testing gem, that provides RSpec- and Minitest-compatible one-liners that test common Rails functionality.
                    These tests would otherwise be much longer, more complex, and error-prone.
